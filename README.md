# Sequence-Webpage
This is my first project where I create a small website that allows you to calculate each element of a sequence given how many iterations you want and the type of sequence.

How to initialize:

- Right-click on index.html and select "Open With" -> your prefered browser.
- The website itself contains the instructions on how to use it.
